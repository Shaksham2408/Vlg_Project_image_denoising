# Denoising Image Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook designed to demonstrate and implement image denoising techniques. Image denoising is a crucial preprocessing step in various computer vision and image processing tasks, aimed at removing noise from an image while preserving important features.

# Contents

- `Denoising Image.ipynb`: The main notebook file containing the implementation of image denoising techniques.
- Sample images: (Optional) A folder containing sample images used for demonstration purposes.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of Python dependencies required to run the notebook.

## Getting Started

# Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`

# Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/denoising-image-notebook.git
   cd denoising-image-notebook

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install the required Python packages:

   pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running the Notebook

1. Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   jupyter notebook

2. Open the `Denoising Image.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the code cells and observe the results of the image denoising techniques.

# Notebook Overview

The `Denoising Image.ipynb` notebook includes the following sections:

1. Introduction: Brief overview of image denoising and its importance.
2. Imports and Setup: Importing necessary libraries and setting up the environment.
3. Loading Images: Loading sample images to be used for denoising.
4. Denoising Techniques:
   - Gaussian Blur
   - Median Filtering
   - Bilateral Filtering
